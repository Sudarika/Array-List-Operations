# ArrayList Operations
This project provides two main operations on an ArrayList of integers: removing odd numbers and doubling even numbers. The operations are demonstrated through a simple Java application.

# Project Structure
- ArrayListOperations.java: Contains methods for removing odd numbers and doubling even numbers.
- TestOperations.java: Contains the main method to test the operations with user input.

# Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- A Java IDE or a text editor with Java support.

# How to Run

1. Clone the Repository:
- git clone <repository_url>

2. Compile the Java Files:
- javac ArrayListOperations.java TestOperations.java

3. Run the Application:
- java TestOperations

4. Input:
- The application will prompt you to enter 5 integer values.

5. Output:
- The original list of numbers.
- The list after removing odd numbers.
- The list after doubling the even numbers.
